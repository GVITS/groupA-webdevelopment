        <p>Navrongo Senior High School is a school in Navrongo which was established in September 1960 by 
            Ghana's first president Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. It was named President's College. The president 
            indicated his dream that this school will become a great centre of learning in the north and that he
             will watch its progress with keen interest. Later, it was simply called Navrongo School (NAVASCO).</p>
        <p> Its mascot is the horn, an important northern Ghanaian symbol of royalty, bravery, and leadership. 
            The school's motto is "LUX BOREALIS" in Latin. It means "The Light of the North". Old students are known
             as NABIA, a local word meaning Citizen.</p>
